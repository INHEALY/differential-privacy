### DP-Auditorium

This folder contains the DP-Auditorium library for auditing differential privacy
guarantees as described in the introductory paper
[DP-Auditorium: a Large Scale Library for Auditing Differential Privacy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.05608).

The root directory is structured as follows. It contains four main folders and a
runner module described below:

*   [Testers](testers/): Contains modules introducing `PropertyTesters` that
    check if there is evidence to reject the hypothesis that a privacy guarantee
    holds on a fixed pair of datasets.
*   [Generators](generators/): Contains modules introducing `DatasetGenerators`
    that output pairs of neighboring datasets, for example under the add/remove
    neighboring relation.
*   [Mechanisms](mechanims/): Contains examples of private and non-private
    mechanisms used to exemplify testers.
*   `privacy_test_runner.py`: Module with runner that specializes to a tester
    and generator and instantiates the `PropertyTester` on several datasets'
    trials generated by the `DatasetGenerator`.
*   [Examples](examples/): Folder containing examples on how to combine the
    above tools.

Details on the signature of the above objects, can be found in the
`interfaces.py` module. For further details please refer to the paper
[DP-Auditorium: a Large Scale Library for Auditing Differential Privacy.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.05608)

## Examples

An illustrative example is available in
`examples/run_mean_mechanism_example.py`. This binary defines a Hockey-Stick
divergence test as the property tester and a dataset generator that employs a
Gaussian process bandit (using OSS Vizier) for suggesting datasets.
Subsequently, the runner is instantiated with these two objects to conduct a
test on a non-private mean mechanism.

There are two ways to run this, either via Bazel or after installing the library
using `setup.py`.

### Run with bazel

For the first option, you need to have
[Bazel installed](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/main/install.html).
Once that is done, run:

```
bazel build dp_auditorium:all
bazel run dp_auditorium/examples:run_mean_mechanism_example
```

### Run via setup.py

For the second option, you will need the
[setuptools package](https://pypi.org/project/setuptools/) installed.
To ensure this, you may run
```
pip install --upgrade setuptools
```
Then, to demonstrate our example, run:
```
python setup.py install
python dp_auditorium/examples/run_mean_mechanism_example.py
```
